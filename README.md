Domain:  Consumer Goods
Function: Executive Management

Project title: Consumer Goods Ad_Hoc Insights
Atliq Hardwares is one of India's leading computer hardware producers and expanded in other countries too.

As the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions so they made 10 ad hoc requests for which they needed insights.

In this project, the tools I used are :
1) MySQL - to query the database.
2) Excel - to visualize the data.
3) PowerPoint - to present the Insights.
